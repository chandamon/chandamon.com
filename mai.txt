Dear Linda and Wesley,

Thanks for the effort for my thesis. Can we meet on this thursday or friday? 


By the way, sorry for being that late to reply, since I got problem with getting the mails from the student mailbox in outlook in different PC.

Best regards,
Damon

>> Damon,

>> Based on your synopsis, I have reconstructed the following as your 
>> thesis:(see if you think it is close)
>> 
>> "Based on the narration of the people who actually lived through 
>> the events
>> and had personal experiences in Tai Ki Leng (?), I constructed a 
>> Yuen Long
>> that is very different from its representation in dominant

>> discovery."
>> Notes:
>> The key sentence is "constructing Yuen Long"... "People's 
>> narration" is
>> supportive and refers to what you gathered...
>> 
>> You should decide whether this is what you're actually doing, 
>> whether the

>> weighed.Based on the above or a revised thesis statement, you 
>> should easily develop a
>> structure/outline for your theoretical text.
